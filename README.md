# 📚 Bookstore Database Design & SQL Project

## 👋 Introduction

This project presents a practical, real-world scenario of building a relational database system for a Bookstore using MySQL. It simulates the role of a Database Administrator responsible for organizing and managing structured data efficiently.

The database is designed to handle various core components of the bookstore, including books, authors, customers, orders, addresses, and shipping methods. Through this implementation, the focus is on creating an optimized, scalable, and secure system that supports daily business operations and analytical reporting.

## 💼 Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to develop a well-structured, relational MySQL database that supports the operational and analytical needs of a bookstore. This involves designing and implementing an efficient schema, establishing relationships, applying normalization principles, and enforcing data integrity through constraints.

This hands-on experience demonstrates the importance of planning, structuring, and securing data for real-world business systems. It emphasizes the relevance of databases in modern digital applications, especially in e-commerce and inventory-based systems.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** – An open-source Relational Database Management System used to build and manage the bookstore database.
- **Draw.io (diagrams.net)** – A diagramming tool used to visualize the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and plan the database schema before implementation.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

To successfully follow through with this project, a good understanding of the following concepts is assumed:
- Basic SQL syntax and operations such as `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `JOIN`, etc.
- Relational database principles including primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization
- MySQL data types and constraints
- User management and permission handling in MySQL

## 🎯 Project Scope

The goal is to build a fully normalized database for a bookstore that covers the following components:

- 📦 Books and their metadata  
- ✍️ Authors and the many-to-many relationship with books  
- 🌍 Book languages and publishers  
- 🛍️ Customers and their associated addresses  
- 📬 Order processing including shipping and status tracking  

This system is capable of supporting essential business operations such as inventory tracking, customer management, and order handling, while enabling meaningful insights through custom SQL queries.

## 🔧 Implementation Workflow

### 1. Database Creation

A new database is initialized to store all related bookstore data objects using standard SQL `CREATE DATABASE` syntax.
